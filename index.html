                 <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5">
                    A denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network.
                    One of the largest verifiable DDoS attacks on record targeted GitHub,
                     a popular online code management service used by millions of developers. This attack reached 1.3 Tbps,
                     sending packets at a rate of 126.9 million per second. The GitHub attack was a memcached DDoS attack, so there were no botnets involved.
                     Instead the attackers leveraged the amplification effect of a popular database caching system known as memcached.
                     By flooding memcached servers with spoofed requests, the attackers were able to amplify their attack by a magnitude of about 50,000x.
                     Luckily, GitHub was using a DDoS protection service, which was automatically alerted within 10 minutes of the start of the attack.
                     This alert triggered the process of mitigation and GitHub was able to stop the attack quickly.
                     The massive DDoS attack only ended up lasting about 20 minutes.

                    <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5">Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. 
While some simple ransomware may lock the system without damaging any files, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion.Hackers have used ransomware to take the website of Ukraine's energy ministry offline and encrypt its files.

The website currently contains a message written in English, demanding a ransom of 0.1 bitcoin - worth $927.86 (£664.98) by today's exchange rate.

                    <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5">A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. After interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco. MITM attacks often occur when a visitor uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers insert themselves between the visitor and the network, and then use malware to install software and use data maliciously.
                         A logistics company at Govandi recently lost $16,000, or Rs10.89 lakh, to an unidentified attacker who hacked its official email account to seek an early payment from its client in Italy.

                    <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5"> Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it and carrying out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine,” Cisco reports.Between 2013 and 2015, Facebook and Google were tricked out of $100 million due to an extended phishing campaign. The phisher took advantage of the fact that both companies used Quanta, a Taiwan-based company, as a vendor. The attacker sent a series of fake invoices to the company that impersonated Quanta, which both Facebook and Google paid.

 

                         Eventually, the scam was discovered, and Facebook and Google took action through the US legal system. The attacker was arrested and extradited from Lithuania, and, as a result of the legal proceedings, Facebook and Google were able to recover $49.7 million of the $100 million stolen from them.

                           According to a cybersecurity consultancy firm, Tesla had hundreds of Kubernetes administration consoles accessible over the internet without any password protection. When hackers found this vulnerability their main purpose wasn’t to steal information but rather to inject cryptojacking scripts.
